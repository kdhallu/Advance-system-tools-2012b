I created this small tool as i wanted to learn dot net.This tools is developed in visual studio usin C# and wmi.

It allows you to do the following things with your system : 

• Change system Settings.
• Backup system settings.
• Reset Firewall.
• Kill Process single or all at Once.
• View Operating system Information.
• View Processor Details Including Clocks and Load of processor in Real-time.
• Tweaks like Enable/Disable Taskmanager, Enable/Disable Balloon tips and adding a recycle bin  in My computer.
• View all the process running in the system and ability to kill them all at once.
• View and Startup items and delete them.
• Deleting Temporary Files on a single click.

Note that this tools is just for experiment purpose and highly unstable.I personally dont take any risk if your system crashes or if you loose any of your data
