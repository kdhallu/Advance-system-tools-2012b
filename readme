I created this small tool since i wanted to explore Dotnet.This tools is developed in visual studio usin C#.

It allows you to do the following things with your system : 

• Change system Settings.
• Backup system settings.
• Reset Firewall.
• Kill system Process.
• View Operating system Information.
• View Processor Details Including Clocks and Load of processor in Real-time.
• Tweaks like Enable/Disable Taskmanager, Enable/Disable Balloon tips and adding a recycle bin  in My computer and more.
• View startup application and disable them.
• Deleting Temporary Files on a single click.

Note that this tools is just for experiment purpose and highly unstable.I personally dont take any risk if your system crashes or if you loose any of your data
